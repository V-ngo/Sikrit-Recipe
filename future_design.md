# Future Design

There is much more room to grow in terms of potential of this app. We recommend designers of similar apps to make sure that users have many options when it comes to searching for recipes and to streamline the process. What we mean by streamlining the process is make it easy for users to search for recipes with ingredients of their choosing. Another more general tip would be to continue with more iteration. Due to the time constraints of the semester, we were unable to iterate more on our high level prototype and run even more user studies.

One thing designers should avoid is expanding the scope of app too readily. We have many different features that have many different screens. However, this made our app lose focus on our main feature of making it easy for users to search for recipes with specific ingredients that they choose. Making sure to cut down on unnecessary ideas/features that are not directly relevant to the problems that you are trying to solve for your users is essential to bring out the best in your app and the most help towards your users.
