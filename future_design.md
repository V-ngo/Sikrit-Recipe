There is much more room to grow in terms of potential of this app. Firstly, even though we made improvements to the search filter screen and upload recipe screen, there are still many different routes we could have taken. For example, we could have kept the modal for searching specific ingredients and whenever users added an ingredient to the filter, we could add a filter tag and list those instead of separating the ingredients by category (this can be done implicityly instead). For the upload a recipe screen, we could have found a better way to design the screen to add alternative ingredients. There are just many different design choices that we could have taken. However, we do believe that the basic concept and top features of our app are essential and should not be so easily changed.

It is essential for designers to not get caught up with an idea too early and to keep an open mind throughout the entire development process. Designers should always be open to feedback especially from users, and the most important thing that designers should take into account is designing systems in a way that makes it easy and efficient for users to navigate, understand, and utilize the system. The most important features/functionality of an application should/must be easily accessible and not buried under different menus. Buttons should be clearly labeled or have distinct icons that are consistent across not only the application itself, but also similar applications.
