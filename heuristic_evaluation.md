# Heuristic Evaluation


The next step we took in iteration was we ran heuristic evaluation tests. For these tests, we went the entire app, looking for unfamiliar or unclear buttons, hard-to-navigate to pages, etc. After finding as many problems as we could, we redesigned/altered the screens of our app to make sure that these problems were minimized or disappeared completely. Here are some screenshots of the before and after heuristic evaluations as well as explanations for the problems and fixes:
