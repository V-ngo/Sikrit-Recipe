# Heuristic Evaluation


The next step we took in iteration was we ran heuristic evaluation tests. For these tests, we went the entire app, looking for unfamiliar or unclear buttons, hard-to-navigate to pages, etc. After finding as many problems as we could, we redesigned/altered the screens of our app to make sure that these problems were minimized or disappeared completely. Here are some screenshots of the before and after heuristic evaluations as well as explanations for the problems and fixes:


## Problems/Solutions

As you can see from the left screenshot above, the search bar is covered by the notch. This occurred on a few other of our screens. So, we fixed this by moving everything down into the safe area.

The problem with the left screenshot above is that it is unclear to the user what the arrow button at the top right hand corner of the page does. It could mean to go to another page or it could be a "Share" button. In order to fix this problem, we instead added a dropdown menu that will have specific labels for what will happen on tap.

The problem with the screenshot on the left is that when the user clicked on the search bar, the app didn't navigate to the search filter screen. On other pages, we had a designated filter button that would navigate to the search filter screen, but we did not want to rely only on a button to allow the user to navigate to the search filter screen. So, we fixed this by making the search bar on every screen automatically navigate to the filter screen. This gave users more options on how to navigate to the search filter screen.

## Conclusion of Heuristic Evaluation Testing

These are just a couple examples of some of the problems we found on our 1st iteration prototype using heuristic evaluation testing, as well as, the solutions/changes we made. Heuristic evaluation testing allowed us to find many problems that we could fix before we ran usability tests which allowed us to get even more valuable feedback because users would not be distracted by blatant errors.
