# Wireframing

## Design Prototyping
After extracting some basic themes from our user research study, we moved onto designing low-fidelity wireframes to get a better sense of how we would design certain features to accomodate our users.


## Wireframes
  After looking at our data analysis from our user study, the main design features we wanted to focus on were the search functionality, the recipe tutorial page, and the upload recipe page. Also, because users will most likely be using our product while cooking in the kitchen, the wireframes we designed are for phone screens.

  We are still in active discussion about possibly changing/combining screens, adding new screens, and seeing if there are any more features that we can add that could complement what we currently have to give users a better experience.

  For the landing page, we have a super simple design that allows users to login or sign up for a SikritRecipe account. However, because we want to give non-registered users opportunities to use our app, we also have an option for users to bypass the sign-in and immediately start searching for recipes.

  We have a very simple and basic design for our login and register screen. Our signup process is very quick and simple. All the user needs is their email and comes up with a good username. It provides users with all of the necessary functionality for logging in or registering. It is a very standard screen.

  After the user is logged in or not, they will see our home page. This screen has the search bar, an explore section, and other new recipes. For our explore section, it shows the top, most viewed, or popular combined list of recipes for users to check out. On the top left corner, there’s a navigation button that can direct the user to their page of interest. Also, the “logout” button only appears once the user is logged in, if not, the “login” button will be replaced instead.

  This is probably the most important page of our app. We want users to be able to easily search for recipes that are quick and delicious. That is why we added the filter for “Under 30 Mins” and the ability to sort by rating and most popular. The next major piece of functionality is allowing users to filter recipes based on ingredients. When users press the filter button in the top right of the screen, it will provide options where users can filter/sort recipes based off of whatever they have entered in the Pantry Page. Then, all recipes that contain these ingredients will be shown sorted by the percentage of the recipe’s ingredients that match with the filtered ingredients. Other options could be sorted by price based on users’ local grocers.

  The pantry page allows users to update the app with what the user has at their disposal in their kitchen for cooking. This allows the app to optimize what recipes to recommend or filter out depending on what the user has immediately available. During our user research, we found that users wanted convenience when cooking and wanted to use what they had. This allows users to find easy recipes they can make with what they have on hand rather than having to figure out what to make and then having to go to the store and get ingredients for that recipe.

  The local grocers option allows the user to input a list of their local grocers into the app. This allows the app to determine the average pricepoint of items related to a recipe in a certain area. For example if you live in a landlocked area where fish on average costs more the app can give you a price point for a recipe based on the price of fish relative to where you live. The app could also look for where things are in stock or sold near you give more exact pricing for items required for a recipe.

  This is a standard page with the name of the recipe, a list of ingredients needed, directions to cook the recipe, and a splash image of the food recipe itself. The page can be scrolled if needed to. The recipe page can be bookmarked for later used using the icon on the top right of the page. The user may go to the previous or the next recipe using the two arrow buttons on the bottom of the page.

  For this wireframe, it is very basic. We are using a similar UI for the recipe instructions’ section, but instead of pictures in the top section, it is replaced with a video. This format is similar to other video/streaming apps such as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitch. Video can be made fullscreen if needed by rotating the phone to the side.

  When designing the main aspects of the upload recipe page, the main concerns that we had was allowing users to provide alternative ingredients, organizing recipes into different steps, and allowing users to include images and videos. The reason we wanted to give users the option to provide alternative ingredients is because of the search feature we want to implement. We want to allow users to search for recipes with ingredients that they have in their homes. Of course, there won’t be many recipes with the exact combination of ingredients that our users may have in their homes, but allowing recipes to have alternative ingredients increases the chances of a user being able to find a recipe with the limited ingredients they may have. The reason we wanted to give users the ability to add multiple steps and within those steps, multiple instructions, is because recipes should be organized in a way where each step in a recipe can be broken down into multiple instructions to allow users to better understand the steps and users posting these recipes can give more detailed information about each step. This is also why we want to give the users the option to input multiple images for each step.
