# Usability Testing

### Usability Test Description

The final step in iteration we took was running user usability tests. We came up with three different usability tests designed around three main features: uploading a new recipe, searching for a recipe, and following a recipe. However, we did run into an issue when designing these usability tests due to the fact that Figma does not take user input (text/keyboard input). Because most of our main features require some text/keyboard input, it was hard to design the usability tests in a way to help users experience exactly how the app would flow. So, the way we decided to structure our usability tests was that we were going to hardcode parts of the flow that required text input and other things such as what recipe users were going to upload or search for, etc. 

The reason it is acceptable to hardcode the results/interactions of what the user should be getting is because we aren't interested in what the user is typing. We are only interested in the flow of the app and if the user can get to the end goal. We can still receive valuable feedback for the flow even without having user input.




### Results

One thing made clear while observing our users during the usability tests was the small screen size. Because we designed our prototype using Figma on a computer with a large monitor screen, it made us overlook some UX issues such as too small of buttons, especially on our search filter screen. Therefore, one of the main changes/improvements we made after our usability tests was to use modals instead of small dropdown menus on small buttons.

Another thing we noticed was that even though users want a lot of control when it comes to inputs, which is why we also added the modal in the filter screen shown above, users still want selectable options as a supplement. We made these changes across the app, especially adding the modal feature that we had in the filter screen shown above, just to keep the app more consistent.
