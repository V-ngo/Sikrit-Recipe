## Problem Space
  With the COVID pandemic, many people are at home more. Without the commute times, people have a lot more time on their hands than they used to, so it is the perfect opportunity for users to cook or learn how to cook. However, with the prevalence of food delivery apps such as *DoorDash, Uber Eats,* etc., people do not see the need for home cooking and eat take out more which is more unhealthy. Also, the price of using these food delivery apps add up which makes it harder to afford to eat out for less affluent individuals.

  Another aspect of the problem is that not everyone has someone that can teach them how to cook. There is also a lack of motivation to cook because people do not usually have anyone to share it with so people are less inclined to pull out all the stops when it comes to cooking.

## Target User
  The primary target users for this app would be young adults. The secondary users for this app would be home cooks and experienced cooks who want to join a community surrounding food.

  In order to better understand our design space, we would need to know why users choose to eat out vs cooking at home, how motivated users are to learn to cook, if users like sharing their cooking experiences with other people, and what stops users from home cooking.

  We believe that this recipe app will support our users to enact care because they will eat more home cooked food which is usually much healthier. Also, users can find a community around food which will motivate them to cook more. On top of this, cooking can be therapeutic and a nice hobby for people to escape/separate from their work.

## User Research Process
  In our SikritRecipe app, two methods that we used for researching user processes were Contextual Inquiries and Interviews. Contextual Inquiries helps us to observe how users cook their daily meals as well as create new recipes. We want to know how fast our users can come up with a dish in mind with available ingredients or they have to think about what to cook and then go out for grocery shopping in order to buy what they need. On the other hand, Interviews help us to understand our users better. Within a similar age group, we learned about some motivations that led them to be better at cooking and understood about their cooking backgrounds.
  
 The total number of people who participated was eight people. The demographic of these participants were people who are in college or had full time jobs and were between the ages of 18-40. We gave participants the option to participate in an interview or a contextual inquiry. During the interviews, our participants were asked to answer all questions that we came up with. We sent them our questions through text messages and emails, then they sent their replies back to us. We also interviewed them by phone and sometimes face to face. For the participants that agreed to participate in a contextual inquiry, we asked the participants the interview questions and some additional questions while also observing them when they were cooking.
 
  We analyzed the data by creating an affinity diagram using a web application called Miro. We coded the answers and observations we received during our user research into smaller pieces. We then grouped up these coded answers based on similarity and themes. We ensured that our themes were consistent mainly because we started off with the basic themes we based our questions off of such as what people thought their cooking obstacles were and what dishes they liked to cook. We then noticed patterns between these basic themes such as where many participants said time was a huge cooking obstacle and some also said that their favorite recipes/dishes were ones that were quick and simple to make. We worked as a team to find these patterns and themes, and we made sure to take a few days off after our first session to make sure we had fresh eyes on it the next time we viewed the affinity diagram.

## Findings
## Cooking Obstacles
### 1 - Time constraints
  A common theme that we found while interviewing our participants was that our participants found the lack of time to be an obstacle to cooking. This can be seen in one of our participant’s answers where we asked what her main obstacle to cooking was: “The primary obstacle when it comes to cooking is time. I have a lot on my plate and there just isn’t enough time in the day to really plan out and cook some extravagant meal.” This participant also agreed to a contextual inquiry so while the interviewer asked these interview questions, he observed the participant’s behavior while she cooked. She seemed slightly annoyed/flustered while answering the questions, which the interviewer believed was due to her needing to stop and think about some of her answers while she was cooking. Also, the participant was scrambling to find cooking equipment she needed, preparing all the ingredients needed, and making sure her kitchen wasn’t becoming messy with used pans, pots, etc. The participant also had to leave the kitchen to answer work-related calls, so the participant was juggling a lot of tasks. Extrapolating this participants situation to others who work full-time jobs and we can assume that these people deal with similar situations where they struggle to cook due to lack of time. 

  This time constraint theme can also be seen in some of our participants favorite recipes. One participant said his favorite recipe is marinated chicken covered in crouton crumbs and his reason for why it was his favorite was due to how quick the recipe is: “It’s my favorite [recipe] because it’s pretty simple, it’s got texture, and it’s fast.” People like quick, easy recipes that are delicious. They don’t want recipes that may take many hours or even days to prepare and create.

### 2 - Thinking of what to cook
  Another common theme we found that we find relevant to the time constraint cooking obstacle was thinking of what to cook. Participants found that thinking of what dishes to cook consumed a lot of time so many of our participants choose to have a set number of dishes that they cook every week to circumvent this issue. Another participant said the way he decides what to cook is based on whatever is available in his house: “Everytime I cook, I check what’s available and just use it and maybe learn something then?” So, combining these two themes, we can imagine a feature that can help users find recipes based off of certain ingredients they say they have. This will not only help users think of what to cook but also maximize their use of ingredients. For example, if a user had ingredients that would expire soon, he/she could search for recipes that contain those soon-to-be expired ingredients. This will help eliminate food waste as well.

### 3 - Mess in the kitchen
  One of the common cooking obstacles that we noticed after interviewing our participants is their concern about the mess they will be creating in the kitchen. Given that most of our participants have mid-to-no-experience in cooking, they found that there will be catastrophic aftermath with their adventurous take on cooking. It is almost as if they don’t cook not because they don’t have the equipment or knowledge to do so, but more concerned that they will have to clean after they spend all the time preparing and cooking their food. One feature that we can implement to combat this problem, is adding cleaning to the recipe itself so that the cleaning can be done as the food is being prepared. Instead of saving all the cleaning at the end, we can start the process of cleaning as they finished using those items. This will solve our problem where people are more reluctant to cook because they don’t want to clean a big mess after. We can also introduce recipes that are low-mess, in which there won’t be that many things to clean and less trash to throw away. To further improve this, we can also introduce left-over recipes, and repurposed meat recipes to lessen food waste.

### 4 - Lack of Motivation
  The biggest cooking concern that we have is the participant’s lack of motivation to cook. Most of the time, people are actually good at cooking but they don’t have enough motivation to do so. As we interviewed our participants, we found a common theme, that will ultimately be our biggest concern, as we see their answers create a huge trend of having little-to-no motivation in cooking. We believe that this concern comes with many factors including the ones mentioned above. When all of the factors and all the other problems are combined into one, it results in a lack of motivation to cook. To further discuss our interview results, we also looked back and noticed that since our demographic age ranges from 18-to-40, the biggest factor why they are not motivated to cook is because they think that it is way easier, faster, and better to buy food or eat out instead of spending the time planning, prepping, and cooking the food themselves. Although this factor can be very hard to combat in our app, we are planning on introducing things that will motivate our users to cook more. By creating a place where they can share, learn, and connect with other people going through the same obstacles in cooking, or even in life, we are hoping to create a positive atmosphere for everyone using our app. 

## Cooking Motivations
### 1 - Money
  Many participants find cooking at home as a way of saving money versus ordering take out: “Being able to save money is the biggest rewarding element of cooking… it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to see the difference between buying food and buying ingredients.” Another participant said, “Take out is too expensive.” People know that home cooking is cheaper but going back to the problem of time constraints when weighing short-term benefits versus long-term benefits during busy times, people would be more likely to choose the short-term benefit. If these people do choose the short-term benefit and they know that take out is more expensive, they would most likely choose to eat cheap fast food or less nutritious food, thus affecting their health.

### 2 - Teaching others to cook
  Some people are born to be teachers in life, with a passion to help others in need and keep them on the right track in life. We saw some of these teachers as we did the interview with our participants. One of the trends that we noticed while asking our participants what their biggest motivation to cook is, is to show the world what they’ve created and share the experience they had while doing so. In SikritRecipe, we are hoping to compliment people's passion and give them a proper platform to showcase their skills and love of teaching. We will create a feature where people can show their love for the community by creating step-by-step cooking recipes alongside a video of them showing how to prepare and cook the food. We will be able to capture people’s passion for teaching and help their fellow cooks along the way. 

### 3 - Sharing Recipes
  Participants want to share recipes they are proud of, primarily through social media or friends/family. Since our app has social elements to it, mainly through the streaming and videos on how to make certain dishes. Users of lesser skill can show off what they have learned, and experienced cooks can teach less skilled users useful information and share tips on how to do something better or faster.

## Design Prototyping
### Wireframes
  After looking at our data analysis from our user study, the main design features we wanted to focus on were the search functionality, the recipe tutorial page, and the upload recipe page. Also, because users will most likely be using our product while cooking in the kitchen, the wireframes we designed are for phone screens.

  We are still in active discussion about possibly changing/combining screens, adding new screens, and seeing if there are any more features that we can add that could complement what we currently have to give users a better experience.

  For the landing page, we have a super simple design that allows users to login or sign up for a SikritRecipe account. However, because we want to give non-registered users opportunities to use our app, we also have an option for users to bypass the sign-in and immediately start searching for recipes.

![image1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72105812/169169364-bb32eab9-0364-4d29-838e-57813cccfa12.png)

  We have a very simple and basic design for our login and register screen. Our signup process is very quick and simple. All the user needs is their email and comes up with a good username. It provides users with all of the necessary functionality for logging in or registering. It is a very standard screen.

![image8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72105812/169169441-b08adb8f-e073-4097-b0da-6cc5577f5dcd.png)
![image3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72105812/169169453-0a2ff60b-ce5a-4e6f-9440-3fb6bfd28f71.png)
  After the user is logged in or not, they will see our home page. This screen has the search bar, an explore section, and other new recipes. For our explore section, it shows the top, most viewed, or popular combined list of recipes for users to check out. On the top left corner, there’s a navigation button that can direct the user to their page of interest. Also, the “logout” button only appears once the user is logged in, if not, the “login” button will be replaced instead.

  This is probably the most important page of our app. We want users to be able to easily search for recipes that are quick and delicious. That is why we added the filter for “Under 30 Mins” and the ability to sort by rating and most popular. The next major piece of functionality is allowing users to filter recipes based on ingredients. When users press the filter button in the top right of the screen, it will provide options where users can filter/sort recipes based off of whatever they have entered in the Pantry Page. Then, all recipes that contain these ingredients will be shown sorted by the percentage of the recipe’s ingredients that match with the filtered ingredients. Other options could be sorted by price based on users’ local grocers.

  The pantry page allows users to update the app with what the user has at their disposal in their kitchen for cooking. This allows the app to optimize what recipes to recommend or filter out depending on what the user has immediately available. During our user research, we found that users wanted convenience when cooking and wanted to use what they had. This allows users to find easy recipes they can make with what they have on hand rather than having to figure out what to make and then having to go to the store and get ingredients for that recipe.

  The local grocers option allows the user to input a list of their local grocers into the app. This allows the app to determine the average pricepoint of items related to a recipe in a certain area. For example if you live in a landlocked area where fish on average costs more the app can give you a price point for a recipe based on the price of fish relative to where you live. The app could also look for where things are in stock or sold near you give more exact pricing for items required for a recipe.

  This is a standard page with the name of the recipe, a list of ingredients needed, directions to cook the recipe, and a splash image of the food recipe itself. The page can be scrolled if needed to. The recipe page can be bookmarked for later used using the icon on the top right of the page. The user may go to the previous or the next recipe using the two arrow buttons on the bottom of the page.

![image7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72105812/169169615-a46cbcc3-8304-40b1-b675-3bd2fef85e79.png)
  For this wireframe, it is very basic. We are using a similar UI for the recipe instructions’ section, but instead of pictures in the top section, it is replaced with a video. This format is similar to other video/streaming apps such as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitch. Video can be made fullscreen if needed by rotating the phone to the side.

![image9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72105812/169169833-5d3785fb-2df3-4d77-b7e1-b3be1a83f148.png)
  When designing the main aspects of the upload recipe page, the main concerns that we had was allowing users to provide alternative ingredients, organizing recipes into different steps, and allowing users to include images and videos. The reason we wanted to give users the option to provide alternative ingredients is because of the search feature we want to implement. We want to allow users to search for recipes with ingredients that they have in their homes. Of course, there won’t be many recipes with the exact combination of ingredients that our users may have in their homes, but allowing recipes to have alternative ingredients increases the chances of a user being able to find a recipe with the limited ingredients they may have. The reason we wanted to give users the ability to add multiple steps and within those steps, multiple instructions, is because recipes should be organized in a way where each step in a recipe can be broken down into multiple instructions to allow users to better understand the steps and users posting these recipes can give more detailed information about each step. This is also why we want to give the users the option to input multiple images for each step.
