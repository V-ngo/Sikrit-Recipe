## Problem Space
  With the COVID pandemic, many people are at home more. Without the commute times, people have a lot more time on their hands than they used to, so it is the perfect opportunity for users to cook or learn how to cook. However, with the prevalence of food delivery apps such as *DoorDash, Uber Eats,* etc., people do not see the need for home cooking and eat take out more which is more unhealthy. Also, the price of using these food delivery apps add up which makes it harder to afford to eat out for less affluent individuals.

  Another aspect of the problem is that not everyone has someone that can teach them how to cook. There is also a lack of motivation to cook because people do not usually have anyone to share it with so people are less inclined to pull out all the stops when it comes to cooking.

## Target User
  The primary target users for this app would be young adults. The secondary users for this app would be home cooks and experienced cooks who want to join a community surrounding food.

  In order to better understand our design space, we would need to know why users choose to eat out vs cooking at home, how motivated users are to learn to cook, if users like sharing their cooking experiences with other people, and what stops users from home cooking.

  We believe that this recipe app will support our users to enact care because they will eat more home cooked food which is usually much healthier. Also, users can find a community around food which will motivate them to cook more. On top of this, cooking can be therapeutic and a nice hobby for people to escape/separate from their work.
